## Introduction
This is an iOS application built using SwiftUI that uses the [TfGM-API-Wrapper Project](https://github.com/dave-t-c/TfGM-API-Wrapper) to retreive and present data related to Manchester Metrolink Services / Stops

## Project Goals
- Create a mobile frontend for the TfGM-API-Wrapper project- Experiment with SwiftUI
- Learn some Swift in the process
- Use some of Swifts features such as MapKit

Please note: This project was created for a bit of fun and to learn a bit more and use SwiftUI, so most likely doesn't follow best practices ðŸ˜€

## Project Status
The project currently features:
- Displaying all stops and the road they are on in a searchable list
- Detailed stop view including a map of the area, it's stop zone and a link to open in Apple maps for directions
- View of live services split by destination, including relevant messages, e.g. for engineering work.
- View of nearby bus stops, national rail stations and cafes for each stop.
- Journey planning between any stop on the network.
